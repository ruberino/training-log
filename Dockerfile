# npm 12+ is required: npm ci with an older npm still runs node-gyp for
# better-sqlite3 instead of using its bundled prebuild, and fails without
# Python/a compiler. node:22-alpine ships Node 22.23.x, which satisfies
# npm 12's own floor, and better-sqlite3 13 ships a prebuilds/linuxmusl-x64.node
# binary, so nothing is compiled on alpine's musl libc.
